# Conventions for ADR

## Tools

To create and manage ADR-s we use [adt-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools)

## Content convention

Obligatory sections are:
- Name (in first line) This is what is displayed in structurizr
- Status
- Context
- Decision

If there is need for additional you can add them freely
