## Status

Accepted

## Context

- We have a polish client and polish development team, so all business-related communication is in polish. 
- All team members prefer to write code in English.
- We want to be prepared for foreign acquisition in some distant future.
- We want to be open for foreign team members
- Literature for the problem in English

## Decision

- All developer-facing documentation and artifacts will be in English (Code, ADR, C2-C3 diagrams, e.t.c)

## Consequences
